            Carrot Cake is a rich and moist spice cake, full of grated carrot, toasted nuts, 
            and crushed pineapple, has great flavor, especially when covered with a tangy 
            sweet Cream Cheese Frosting. The interesting part is that while those pretty orange 
            flecks of grated carrot give the Carrot Cake color, sweetness, and a moist texture, 
            its flavor is almost indistinguishable.
