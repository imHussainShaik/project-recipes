        <h3><p>Biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special 
            occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, 
            but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
